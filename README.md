### Future Implementations 
- More complex webapp: multipage, incorporating a backend, providing results in a downloadable-format (ex: pdf)
- Make UI more cohesive to Arpari's homepage style: using the same font, background, buttons style
- Make the webpage responsive 
- Conduct unit testing to ensure proper behavior is executed
- Implement ways to standardize input data. Ex: date formatting
